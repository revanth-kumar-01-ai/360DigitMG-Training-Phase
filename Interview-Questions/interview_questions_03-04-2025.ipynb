    "The primary advantage of using data visualization tools is that they help extract useful insights easily. Compared to traditional methods, these tools use libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, etc., to create graphical diagrams such as **histograms**, **scatter plots**, **multivariate plots**, and **box plots**.\n",
