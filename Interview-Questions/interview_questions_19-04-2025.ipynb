    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning\n",

    "### Difference \n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Machine learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Machine Learning needs manual feature selection and works well with small to medium-sized data. It uses simple models like SVM and Decision Trees. These models are fast to train, require less computation power, and usually run well on CPUs üíª. Traditional ML is best suited for structured, tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning does feature engineering automatically, so no need to hand-pick features. It can handle large amounts of data and uses complex neural networks. Training is slow but very powerful. It needs high computation power and works best with GPU (not just CPU üíª). Deep learning is great for images, speech, and video.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and it's built on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "An ANN is inspired by how the human brain works. It consists of layers of neurons (nodes) that process and learn from data. In Deep Learning, these ANNs are made much deeper (more layers) to solve complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning uses these deep neural networks to automatically find patterns in large datasets, such as images, speech, or text. The more layers in a network, the better it can learn complex features on its own, which is why it's so powerful for tasks like image recognition, speech recognition üéß, and language translation."
